# 🧠 Neural Network Training Visualization with TensorBoard

This project demonstrates how to build and monitor a deep learning model using TensorFlow and TensorBoard.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Train a neural network on tabular data and use TensorBoard to visualize the model's training performance over time. This includes tracking accuracy, loss, and detecting overfitting using validation curves.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- TensorBoard
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib

---

## 🚀 Workflow

1. Preprocess dataset (cleaning, normalization)
2. Build a neural network using Keras
3. Use callbacks to monitor training via TensorBoard
4. Visualize metrics: training loss, validation loss, accuracy
5. Apply techniques like Dropout and EarlyStopping
